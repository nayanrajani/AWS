Working with cross-site scripting match conditions
Attackers sometimes insert scripts into web requests in an effort to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. You can create one or more cross-site scripting match conditions to identify the parts of web requests, such as the URI or the query string, that you want AWS WAF Classic to inspect for possible malicious scripts. Later in the process, when you create a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or block requests that appear to contain malicious scripts.

Web Application Firewall -
You can now use AWS WAF to protect your web applications on your Application Load Balancers. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

Amazon RDS Read Replicas -

Enhanced performance -
You can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications to the read replica. Read replicas allow you to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. Because read replicas can be promoted to master status, they are useful as part of a sharding implementation.
To further maximize read performance, Amazon RDS for MySQL allows you to add table indexes directly to Read Replicas, without those indexes being present on the master.

Amazon RDS uses the MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server DB engines' built-in replication functionality to create a special type of
DB instance called a read replica from a source DB instance. Updates made to the source DB instance are asynchronously copied to the read replica. You can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications to the read replica.
When you create a read replica, you first specify an existing DB instance as the source. Then Amazon RDS takes a snapshot of the source instance and creates a read-only instance from the snapshot. Amazon RDS then uses the asynchronous replication method for the DB engine to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance. The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections. Applications connect to a read replica the same way they do to any DB instance. Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance.

Question #114Topic 1
Currently, a business runs a web application that is backed up by an Amazon RDS MySQL database. It features daily automatic backups that are not encrypted. A security audit entails the encryption of future backups and the destruction of unencrypted backups. Before deleting the previous backups, the firm will create at least one encrypted backup.

What should be done to allow encrypted backups in the future?

A. Enable default encryption for the Amazon S3 bucket where backups are stored.
B. Modify the backup section of the database configuration to toggle the Enable encryption check box.
C. Create a snapshot of the database. Copy it to an encrypted snapshot. Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot. Most Voted
D. Enable an encrypted read replica on RDS for MySQL. Promote the encrypted read replica to primary. Remove the original database instance.
 
Correct Answer: C üó≥Ô∏è
However, because you can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted DB snapshot, you can effectively add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance. That is, you can create a snapshot of your DB instance, and then create an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot, and thus you have an encrypted copy of your original DB instance.
DB instances that are encrypted can't be modified to disable encryption.
You can't have an encrypted read replica of an unencrypted DB instance or an unencrypted read replica of an encrypted DB instance.
Encrypted read replicas must be encrypted with the same key as the source DB instance when both are in the same AWS Region.
You can't restore an unencrypted backup or snapshot to an encrypted DB instance.
To copy an encrypted snapshot from one AWS Region to another, you must specify the KMS key identifier of the destination AWS Region. This is because KMS encryption keys are specific to the AWS Region that they are created in.

Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è
◊í‚Ç¨With target tracking scaling policies, you select a scaling metric and set a target value. Amazon EC2 AutoScaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling policy and calculates the scaling djustment based on the metric and the target value. The scaling policy adds or removes capacity as required to keep the metric at, or close to, the specified target value. In addition to keeping the metric close to the targetvalue, a target tracking scaling policy also adjusts to changes in the metric due to a changing load pattern. For example, you can use target tracking scaling to: Configure a target tracking scaling policy to keep the average aggregate CPU utilization of your Auto Scaling group at 40 percent. Configure a target tracking scaling policy to keep the request count per target of your Application Load Balancer target group at 1000 for your AutoScaling group.◊í‚Ç¨

B. Create a Multi-AZ RDS Read Replica of the production RDS DB instance.
C. Create multiple RDS Read Replicas of the production RDS DB instance. Place the Read Replicas in an Auto Scaling group.
D. Create a Single-AZ RDS Read Replica of the production RDS DB instance. Create a second Single-AZ RDS Read Replica from the replica.
 
Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è
Amazon RDS Read Replicas Now Support Multi-AZ Deployments
Amazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS
Region. Updates made to the source database are then asynchronously copied to your Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, Read Replicas can be promoted to become a standalone database instance when needed.
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.
You can now use Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery (DR) strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested DR plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. A Read Replica in a different region than the source database can be used as a standby database and promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.

Question #172Topic 1
Each month, a business must create sales reports. On the first day of each month, the reporting procedure starts 20 Amazon EC2 instances. The procedure lasts seven days and cannot be paused. The corporation wishes to keep expenses low.

Which pricing strategy should the business pursue?

A. Reserved Instances
B. Spot Block Instances
C. On-Demand Instances
D. Scheduled Reserved Instances
 
Correct Answer: D üó≥Ô∏è
Explanation -

Scheduled Reserved Instances -
Scheduled Reserved Instances (Scheduled Instances) enable you to purchase capacity reservations that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, with a specified start time and duration, for a one-year term. You reserve the capacity in advance, so that you know it is available when you need it. You pay for the time that the instances are scheduled, even if you do not use them.
Scheduled Instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on a regular schedule. For example, you can use Scheduled
Instances for an application that runs during business hours or for batch processing that runs at the end of the week.
If you require a capacity reservation on a continuous basis, Reserved Instances might meet your needs and decrease costs.

How Scheduled Instances Work -
Amazon EC2 sets aside pools of EC2 instances in each Availability Zone for use as Scheduled Instances. Each pool supports a specific combination of instance type, operating system, and network.
To get started, you must search for an available schedule. You can search across multiple pools or a single pool. After you locate a suitable schedule, purchase it.
You must launch your Scheduled Instances during their scheduled time periods, using a launch configuration that matches the following attributes of the schedule that you purchased: instance type, Availability Zone, network, and platform. When you do so, Amazon EC2 launches EC2 instances on your behalf, based on the specified launch specification. Amazon EC2 must ensure that the EC2 instances have terminated by the end of the current scheduled time period so that the capacity is available for any other Scheduled Instances it is reserved for. Therefore, Amazon EC2 terminates the EC2 instances three minutes before the end of the current scheduled time period.
You can't stop or reboot Scheduled Instances, but you can terminate them manually as needed. If you terminate a Scheduled Instance before its current scheduled time period ends, you can launch it again after a few minutes. Otherwise, you must wait until the next scheduled time period.
The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a Scheduled Instance.

AWS Lambda -
With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service ◊í‚Ç¨" all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

How it works -


Amazon API Gateway -
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and
WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.

Question #191Topic 1
On Amazon EC2, a business hosts an ecommerce application. The application is composed of a stateless web layer that needs a minimum of 10 instances and a maximum of 250 instances to run. 80% of the time, the program needs 50 instances.

Which solution should be adopted in order to keep expenses down?

A. Purchase Reserved Instances to cover 250 instances.
B. Purchase Reserved Instances to cover 80 instances. Use Spot Instances to cover the remaining instances.
C. Purchase On-Demand Instances to cover 40 instances. Use Spot Instances to cover the remaining instances.
D. Purchase Reserved Instances to cover 50 instances. Use On-Demand and Spot Instances to cover the remaining instances.
 
Correct Answer: D üó≥Ô∏è
Reserved Instances -
Having 50 EC2 RIs provide a discounted hourly rate and an optional capacity reservation for EC2 instances. AWS Billing automatically applies your RI's discounted rate when attributes of EC2 instance usage match attributes of an active RI.
If an Availability Zone is specified, EC2 reserves capacity matching the attributes of the RI. The capacity reservation of an RI is automatically utilized by running instances matching these attributes.
You can also choose to forego the capacity reservation and purchase an RI that is scoped to a region. RIs that are scoped to a region automatically apply the RI's discount to instance usage across AZs and instance sizes in a region, making it easier for you to take advantage of the RI's discounted rate.

On-Demand Instance -
On-Demand instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (minimum of 60 seconds) with no long-term commitments. This frees you from the costs and complexities of planning, purchasing, and maintaining hardware and transforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable costs.
The pricing below includes the cost to run private and public AMIs on the specified operating system (◊í‚Ç¨Windows Usage◊í‚Ç¨ prices apply to Windows Server 2003 R2,
2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019). Amazon also provides you with additional instances for Amazon EC2 running Microsoft Windows with SQL
Server, Amazon EC2 running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Amazon EC2 running Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Amazon EC2 running IBM that are priced differently.

Spot Instances -
A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. The hourly price for a Spot Instance is called a Spot price. The Spot price of each instance type in each Availability Zone is set by Amazon EC2, and adjusted gradually based on the long-term supply of and demand for Spot Instances. Your
Spot Instance runs whenever capacity is available and the maximum price per hour for your request exceeds the Spot price.

Question #218Topic 1
A business must share an Amazon S3 bucket with a third-party provider. All items must be accessible to the bucket owner.

Which procedure should be followed in order to share the S3 bucket?

A. Update the bucket to be a Requester Pays bucket.
B. Update the bucket to enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
C. Create a bucket policy to require users to grant bucket-owner-full-control when uploading objects.
D. Create an IAM policy to require users to grant bucket-owner-full-control when uploading objects.
 
Correct Answer: C üó≥Ô∏è
By default, an S3 object is owned by the AWS account that uploaded it. This is true even when the bucket is owned by another account. To get access to the object, the object owner must explicitly grant you (the bucket owner) access. The object owner can grant the bucket owner full control of the object by updating the access control list (ACL) of the object. The object owner can update the ACL either during a put or copy operation, or after the object is added to the bucket.

Object Versioning -
[1]
(version 222222) in a single bucket. S3 Versioning protects you from the consequences of unintended overwrites and deletions. You can also use it to archive objects so that you have access to previous versions.
To customize your data retention approach and control storage costs, use object versioning with Object lifecycle management. For information about creating S3
Lifecycle policies using the AWS Management Console, see How Do I Create a Lifecycle Policy for an S3 Bucket? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console
User Guide.
If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.)
You must explicitly enable S3 Versioning on your bucket. By default, S3 Versioning is disabled. Regardless of whether you have enabled Versioning, each object in your bucket has a version ID. If you have not enabled Versioning, Amazon S3 sets the value of the version ID to null. If S3 Versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.
Enabling and suspending versioning is done at the bucket level. When you enable versioning on an existing bucket, objects that are already stored in the bucket are unchanged. The version IDs (null), contents, and permissions remain the same. After you enable S3 Versioning for a bucket, each object that is added to the bucket gets a version ID, which distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.
Only Amazon S3 generates version IDs, and they can't be edited. Version IDs are Unicode, UTF-8 encoded, URL-ready, opaque strings that are no more than
1,024 bytes long. The following is an example: 3/L4kqtJlcpXroDTDmJ+rmSpXd3dIbrHY+MTRCxf3vjVBH40Nr8X8gdRQBpUMLUo.

Using MFA delete -
If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA Delete◊í‚Ç¨"enabled, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the versioning state of the bucket. Requests that include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS. The header's value is the concatenation of your authentication device's serial number, a space, and the authentication code displayed on it. If you do not include this request header, the request fails.

What actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that these criteria are met? (Select two.)?

A. Increase the number of EC2 instances.
B. Decrease the number of EC2 instances.
C. Configure a Network Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instances.
D. Configure an Application Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instances.
E. Configure an Auto Scaling group to add or remove instances in multiple Availability Zones automatically.
 
Correct Answer: CE üó≥Ô∏è
Network Load Balancer overview -
A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.
When you enable an Availability Zone for the load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing creates a load balancer node in the Availability Zone. By default, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in its Availability Zone only. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. For more information, see Availability Zones.
If you enable multiple Availability Zones for your load balancer and ensure that each target group has at least one target in each enabled Availability Zone, this increases the fault tolerance of your applications. For example, if one or more target groups does not have a healthy target in an Availability Zone, we remove the
IP address for the corresponding subnet from DNS, but the load balancer nodes in the other Availability Zones are still available to route traffic. If a client doesn't honor the time-to-live (TTL) and sends requests to the IP address after it is removed from DNS, the requests fail.
For TCP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and TCP sequence number. The TCP connections from a client have different source ports and sequence numbers, and can be routed to different targets. Each individual TCP connection is routed to a single target for the life of the connection.
For UDP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port. A UDP flow has the same source and destination, so it is consistently routed to a single target throughout its lifetime. Different UDP flows have different source IP addresses and ports, so they can be routed to different targets.
An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.
The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.
An Auto Scaling group starts by launching enough instances to meet its desired capacity. It maintains this number of instances by performing periodic health checks on the instances in the group. The Auto Scaling group continues to maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance becomes unhealthy. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the group terminates the unhealthy instance and launches another instance to replace it.

Question #251Topic 1
A solutions architect is creating storage for an Amazon Linux-based high performance computing (HPC) environment. The workload saves and analyzes a huge number of engineering drawings, which necessitates the use of shared storage and high-performance computation.

Which storage choice is the best?

A. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
B. Amazon FSx for Lustre
C. Amazon EC2 instance store
D. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
 
Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è
Explanation -

Amazon FSx for Lustre -
Amazon FSx for Lustre is a new, fully managed service provided by AWS based on the Lustre file system. Amazon FSx for Lustre provides a high-performance file system optimized for fast processing of workloads such as machine learning, high performance computing (HPC), video processing, financial modeling, and electronic design automation (EDA).
FSx for Lustre allows customers to create a Lustre filesystem on demand and associate it to an Amazon S3 bucket. As part of the filesystem creation, Lustre reads the objects in the buckets and adds that to the file system metadata. Any Lustre client in your VPC is then able to access the data, which gets cached on the high- speed Lustre filesystem. This is ideal for HPC workloads, because you can get the speed of an optimized Lustre file system without having to manage the complexity of deploying, optimizing, and managing the Lustre cluster.
Additionally, having the filesystem work natively with Amazon S3 means you can shut down the Lustre filesystem when you don't need it but still access objects in
Amazon S3 via other AWS Services. FSx for Lustre also allows you to also write the output of your HPC job back to Amazon S3.

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume ◊í‚Ç¨" there is no charge when your code is not running. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service ◊í‚Ç¨" all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that AWS
Lambda supports.
Storing your static content with S3 provides a lot of advantages. But to help optimize your application's performance and security while effectively managing cost, we recommend that you also set up Amazon CloudFront to work with your S3 bucket to serve and protect the content. CloudFront is a content delivery network
(CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of
CloudFront can be more cost effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.
CloudFront serves content through a worldwide network of data centers called Edge Locations. Using edge servers to cache and serve content improves performance by providing content closer to where viewers are located. CloudFront has edge servers in locations all around the world.
